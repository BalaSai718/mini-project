                Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English and British English), or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies” (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game for 
                two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical 
                row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient 
                Egypt,where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around 
                the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three; thus, they had 
                to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. Another closely related ancient game is three 
                men's morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish,[8] and Picaria, a game of the Puebloans.

                The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, 
                the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and 
                gas).Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the 
                mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator 
                was affordable to most and they became common in schools.Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as 
                dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and 
                dictionary devices.
